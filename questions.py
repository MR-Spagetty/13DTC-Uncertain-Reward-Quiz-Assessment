I discovered there is a bug that forms, where the question
doesnâ€™t re-roll for another random selection,
it simply re-uses the previous one. I think
I know the problem, check the correct answer question.
Despite this, it is able to check for correct or
incorrect answers, and stops the game when incorrect,
and scores points when done.
